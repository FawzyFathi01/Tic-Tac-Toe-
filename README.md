# Tic Tac Toe  Game

## Project Summary
The Tic Tac Toe Console Game is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C#. It offers two modes of play: two-player mode and player vs. computer mode. The game provides a user-friendly interface where players can input their moves via the keyboard, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Key Features
- **Game Modes:** Players can choose between two-player mode or player vs. computer mode, adding flexibility and catering to different preferences.
- **Interactive Interface:** The game prompts players to enter their moves and displays the updated game board after each turn, providing a clear and interactive experience.
- **Error Handling:** The program includes error handling mechanisms to ensure that players input valid moves and to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.
- **Dynamic Play:** The game dynamically switches between players and updates the game state, allowing for seamless gameplay until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.
- **Play Again Option:** After each game, players have the option to play again or exit, enhancing replayability and user engagement.

## Project Implementation
- The project is implemented in C# using object-oriented programming principles.
- It consists of a `TicTacToeGame` class that manages the game logic and a `Program` class containing the main method to start the game.
- The game board is represented using a 3x3 array, and player input is validated to ensure legal moves.
- The game checks for win conditions by examining rows, columns, and diagonals, and it detects draws when no more moves are possible.
- The user interface is implemented using the console, providing a simple yet effective way to interact with the game.

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the program.
2. Choose the desired game mode: two players or player vs. computer.
3. Enter the names of the players and their respective symbols (X or O).
4. Follow the prompts to make moves and play the game.
5. After each game, choose whether to play again or exit.

## Conclusion
The Tic Tac Toe Console Game is a fun and educational project that demonstrates proficiency in C# programming and object-oriented design. It offers an enjoyable gaming experience while showcasing essential programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. This project would be a valuable addition to a resume, highlighting both technical skills and creativity in game development.
